        ### Options
        
        In this section there are some boolean variables to tune what the code will do:
        
        * train_model -> True: the network will be trained / False: network wont' be trained
        * model_loss -> True: plot the model loss / False: don't plot the model loss
        * model_accuracy -> True: plot the model accuracy / False: don't plot the model accuracy
        * evaluate_model -> True: evaluate the model / False: don't evaluate the model
        * conf_matr -> True: plot the confusion matrix / False: don't plot the confusion matrix
        * plot_model -> True: plot the structure of the network / False: don't plot the structure of the network
        * save_model -> True: save the model / False: don't save the model
